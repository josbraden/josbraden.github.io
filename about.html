                This site is hosted as a Github user page for me, josbraden.
                <br />
                It's coded and maintained by hand in HTML by me - can you tell I'm not really a web guy?
                <br />
                The inspiration for the *extremely* minimal design largly originated from <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a certain parodic website</a> that may or may not actually be parodic.
