                This is the personal website of me, Josh Braden.
                <br />
                After following community college to a logical conclusion, I earned a BS from Sam Houston State University in Computer Science, with a concentration in information security.

                This site is hosted as a Github user page for me, josbraden.
                <br />
                It's coded and maintained by hand in HTML by me - can you tell I'm not really a web guy?
                <br />
                The inspiration for the *extremely* minimal design largly originated from <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a certain parodic website</a> that may or may not actually be parodic.
                <br />
                You have to admit, if you can get beyond the simplicity of the design it's a perfectly functioning website: one directory, few pages, couple of pictures.
                <br />
                Auto-resizes so it looks fine on any sized screen: almost everyone's guaranteed to get the message the site's throwing at you - that I'm not a web designer.
